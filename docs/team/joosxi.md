### Project: Watson, The Teacher's Companion

Watson is a desktop database application that
reduces the administrative workload of teachers greatly. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI 
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 
10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * `Find Command with Prefix`
    * What it does: Allows the user to find a student 
    in Watson by searching via "NAME", "STUDENT_CLASS"
    and/or "SUBJECT" keywords, entering these keywords
    after the prefixes "n/", "c/" and "s/" respectively.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to have
    flexibility in finding students inside Watson, as 
    users can find not just by name but by class and 
    subject as well.
  * `Mark Attendance Command`
    * What it does: Allows the user to mark attendance for
    multiple students in a particular class and on a 
    particular day, using their assigned index numbers.
    * Justification: Allowing the marking of attendance
    for multiple students at once speeds up the process,
    and the one-liner command makes it faster than a 
    similar GUI interface.
