### Project: Watson, The Teacher's Companion

Watson is a desktop database application that
reduces the administrative workload of teachers greatly.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**:
  * `Login Page`: Added a login page for the application.
    * What it does: allows the user to log in to the application.
    * Justification: This feature is useful in ensuring that data related to a user can only be accessed with the user's login details.
    * Note that the current feature is a placeholder due to the nature of the project (desktop application). In the future,
    with a potential move to an online-based application, this feature will be more useful.
